Crawford's Lessons
+ Stories are complex structures that must meet many hard-to-specify requirements
+ Stories are about people, not things
+ Stories are about conflict, most commonly social conflict.
+ Puzzles are a necessary component of stories.
+ Spectacle does not make stories.
+ Visual thinking should not dominate stories.
+ Stories take place on stages, not maps.
+ Your designs should aspire to the ideal of metaphorically having sex with your users.
+ Fast turnaround is always better than slow turnaround.
+ The overall quality of an interaction depends on its depth, as well as speed

* Bots have an intent - that's the job to be done
* There are muliple ways to phrase things (synonyms)
* You need a "sorry, I didn't understand that" unhappy path to start
* You can caputure selections and freetext data to improve the experience
* You vesion the conversation experience just like any other software
* You can use lambdas and models to enrich the conversation

* A themed experience tells a story by creating an immersive narrative environment that is based on a popular book or film or an original story.
* Not just a theme park, retail spaces, restaurants, museums, libraries, zoos and aquariums can all fit into this category — as long as they have created unique, themed environments that guests can explore.
* http://www.inparkmagazine.com/what-should-themed-experience-graduates-know-say-and-do/
* To have a successful career in the themed entertainment industry, students need to know how to collaborate within interdisciplinary teams, by knowing what other team members do, and having empathy for other viewpoints and perspectives.
* From this advice and insight, we begin to form a sequence of study based upon four tenets.
* > #1 – Context.
* > #2 – Skills, aesthetics and creativity.
* > #3 – Collaboration.
* > #4 – The industry.

* Here's a starter process for designing an interaction
* > Define the ideas your client wants to communicate.
* > List the basic elements of your project:
· videos	· sounds and music
· photographs	· drawings and designs
· text articles	· voice
* > Plan your project on paper.
· Storyboard	· Diagram
· Flow Chart
* > Choose the appropriate programming tools:
· ClarisWorks	· Persuasion
· HyperCard	· Astound
* Also, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Persuasion
* Adobe Pesuasion was an interactive presentation tool - a predecessor to powerpoint
* https://winworldpc.com/product/astound-presentation/70
* Astound is a powerful multimedia presentation authoring program originally for the Mac and Windows. Astound gives you the power to create presentations that persuade, inform, and entertain. - competed and succeeded by Powerpoint
* Also, https://www.redsharknews.com/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-interactive-cd-rom
* CD-ROM came into the world in the early 90s, just before the internet had really taken off 
* The emerging CD-ROM industry saw itself as separate from the fledgling computer games industry (still working mostly on floppy disc) and very different from the movie business. 
* It couldn’t deliver full screen, full motion video, but it could give you decent audio and lovely graphics with lots of things to click on to lead you to other screens. 
* CD-ROM seemed to be particularly popular on Apple Macs. Macs were still (just about) in ascendance, and HyperCard (a basic programming tool supplied free with Macs) made it relatively easy to author a disc. 
* There was a notion among some filmmakers that this was, somehow, the future of movies.
* The big problem with CD-ROM was that the technology could not deliver anything close to full screen movies. 
* One hugely successful release showed the way forward, and that was the HyperCard-based single-player adventure/puzzle game Myst, originally launched for the Mac in 1993. In six months it sold 200,000 copies, after porting to Windows it went on to sell well over 6 million. 
* Of course, out of the various notions of what CD-ROM was for, games would end up being the great winner, particularly after the rise of the dedicated games console.
*  DVD arrived in the mid 90s to takeover as the premium format for movies, and most of the educational ambitions of the interactive CD-ROM would be subsumed by the internet. 
*  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard
*  HyperCard is a software application and development kit for Apple Macintosh and Apple IIGS computers. It is among the first successful hypermedia systems predating the World Wide Web.
*  HyperCard combines a flat-file database with a graphical, flexible, user-modifiable interface.[2] HyperCard includes a built-in programming language called HyperTalk for manipulating data and the user interface.
*  This combination of features – a database with simple form layout, flexible support for graphics, and ease of programming – suits HyperCard for many different projects such as rapid application development of applications and databases, interactive applications with no database requirements, command and control systems, and many examples in the demoscene.
*  Also, hypertalk https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperTalk
*  HyperTalk favored natural-language ordering of predicates over the ordering used in mathematical notation.
*  HyperCard's primary user interface concept was the card.
*  The graphical layout of the card was created using the mouse by placing various elements on the card, such as text fields and buttons.
*  Containers of a given type were also available as collections with a pluralized version of that container type as its name—the collection of the fields on a card was card fields. 
*  A notable feature of the HyperTalk container model was its handling of text. Every collection of text, whether a literal string in a program or text typed into a text field, was itself considered a container with multiple collections of containers within it
*  HyperTalk used an object-oriented concept for calling scripts, with objects in the stack sending "events" as messages that would be processed by handlers that declared their interest in receiving the events using the on syntax. For instance, most GUI containers would send the mouseDown message when the mouse button was clicked down, and then a mouseUp message when it was released .
*  Messages for events were first sent to the script in the object that created the even
*  One unique distinction between HyperCard's programming language HyperTalk and seemingly similar languages like AppleScript was that HyperTalk scripts were more lenient in what input they accepted
*  Although the HyperTalk language languished just like HyperCard itself, it received a second lease on life through its plugin protocol, so-called External Commands (XCMDs) and External Functions (XFCNs), which were native code containers attached to stacks (as Macintosh-specific resources) with a single entry point and return value.

*  Inform is a programming language and design system for interactive fiction originally created in 1993 by Graham Nelson

* Why bother with interativity?
* Competitive advantage of computer-driven content (by nature of the conversation, computers are made for interactviity)
* Revolutionary - most of the work in this field has never been done. It's a field for explorers and pioneers.
* Power to influnce - due to the natuer of engagment, people are part of the equation and they can be incluenced by the stories you tell
* How interactive story telling is the same and different from games
> * Both tell stories, but games are not very good at stories
> * Games have an objective and competition
> * Games can be replayed and have the same experience, interactive stories are based on choice so they are "created" each time 


Interactive Storytelling - Crawford

TIL: PP 37-42 Interactive Storytelling - Crawford
* The three determinants of interactivty: speed, depth, and choice.
* The faster the feedback turn time, the more interction is possible
* Depth refers to how much mental exertion is required to focus on the activity / task
* Choice - the optins a player / user has. It's not important the number of choices as much as the quality of choices
* Functional significance means to what degree the choice sastisfies a users needs or goals
* Functional bloat is adding functionality that is not functionally significant to a user
* Its important to note that what is functional bloat to one user is functionaly significant to another user.
* You have to balance this for all players.
* ALWAYS ASK, WHAT DOES A USER DO? WHAT ARE THE VERBS?

* Targets are items that can be watched or listened for by the application 
* Recognition of targets triggers a behavior
* Images, video, and other content can be presented as a behavior when a target is recognized
* Targets work much like QR codes

* Interactivty in Unity is based on scripts
* You can get UNITY here: https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download
* Animation is a tactic to increase interactivity
* You can use proximity as a trigger too
* You can add interfaces into scenes to increase interactivty

TIL: PP 33-37 Interactive Storytelling - Crawford
* People create mental model of the world, this is connected to many different external pieces = their network of understanding of the world around them
* Artists of other mediums can affort to not listen to their audience, but due to the nature of interactivity it is important to reveal the discrepencies between the artists vision and the audience's network
* It is also important that the artist has a vision so that the experience is unified
* Not all feedback needs to be incorporated or the final result will be come muddy, and useless
* And the artist can not solely rely on their ego and vision, elsewise it will miss the mark
* Example of the king taking all the resources for himself, it doesn't work out. He needs to do what's best for the people.
* It is the artists responsibiity to meet each player head-on and make sure they get it.
* Iteractivity isn't binary, or boolean, there is a spectrum of interactivty
* It is a numeric quantity like weight
* Sex, for example is on the high end fo that scale. It's the deepest interaction two people can have.
* Three factors determine the degree of interactivity in storytellng: speed, depth, and choice.

4.17.21
TIL: PP 30-33 Interactive Storytelling - Crawford
* Second-person insight - the ability to experience the story from another's point of view
* Most great artists have a technical inight that allows them to produce great works
* To produce great interactive stories you need to understand how your player / participant / user will interpret and react
* This is more complex than an entertainer who just needs to know which jokes are funny for an example to an audience
* Interactive storytelling has to anticpate reaction to a whole universe of things.
* This involves being able to think like that second person, even when they may think very differently from you.
* Repetition is the way to enforce learning. There may need to be many different ways of saying the same thing to get to all members.

02.16.21
TIL: PP 28-30 Interactive Storytelling - Crawford
* Spatial thinking and reasoning is part of a story
* Place = Stage
* Stage is a general place where the story takes place
* It need not be connected to another stage in the story
* It need not be overly well defined, unless its important to the interaction between the people in the story
* Time is even less important, it's difficult for people to process the passage of time so you can break the rules and/or pay less respect to the laws of time in a story
* Interaction can be defined as listening, thinking, and speaking
* Computers "listen" for input like via the mouse or keyboard
* Computers "think" by processing information
* Computers "speak" by showing words on the screen
* The above ar some examples of how computers act
* Two parties must both do the interaction steps for it to be an interaction, otherwise it's one-sided, a reaction

* The Sensorama, from U.S. Patent #3050870
* The Sensorama was a machine that is one of the earliest known examples of immersive, multi-sensory (now known as multimodal) technology.
* Sensorama was introduced in 1962 by Morton Heilig.
* Mortin Helig was a pioneer in Virtual Reality (VR) technology and filmmaker.
* The Sensorama game gave the player the experience of riding a motorcycle on the streets of Brooklyn. The player felt the wind on their face, the vibration of the motorcycle seat, a 3D view, and even smells of the city.
