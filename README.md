Crawford's Lessons
+ Stories are complex structures that must meet many hard-to-specify requirements
+ Stories are about people, not things
+ Stories are about conflict, most commonly social conflict.
+ Puzzles are a necessary component of stories.
+ Spectacle does not make stories.
+ Visual thinking should not dominate stories.
+ Stories take place on stages, not maps.

TIL: PP 28-30 Interactive Storytelling - Crawford
* Spatial thinking and reasoning is part of a story
* Place = Stage
* Stage is a general place where the story takes place
* It need not be connected to another stage in the story
* It need not be overly well defined, unless its important to the interaction between the people in the story
* Time is even less important, it's difficult for people to process the passage of time so you can break the rules and/or pay less respect to the laws of time in a story
* Interaction can be defined as listening, thinking, and speaking
* Computers "listen" for input like via the mouse or keyboard
* Computers "think" by processing information
* Computers "speak" by showing words on the screen
* The above ar some examples of how computers act
* Two parties must both do the interaction steps for it to be an interaction, otherwise it's one-sided, a reaction
