Crawford's Lessons
+ Stories are complex structures that must meet many hard-to-specify requirements
+ Stories are about people, not things
+ Stories are about conflict, most commonly social conflict.
+ Puzzles are a necessary component of stories.
+ Spectacle does not make stories.
+ Visual thinking should not dominate stories.
+ Stories take place on stages, not maps.
+ Your designs should aspire to the ideal of metaphorically having sex with your users.
+ Fast turnaround is always better than slow turnaround.

*  we’re seeing a total decline in visitor numbers since the 2016-2017 year. In fact, the National Portrait Gallery is down 11% in visits and the National History Museum is down 14%. 
* It’s all about curating the right technologies for your museum guests
*  The guests point the device at certain museum sculptures, paintings, and other artefacts, and are able to learn more about them from where they are standing. 
*  The device is also helpful for navigating the large museum. 
*  there is a variety of digital screen-based activities all in a room within the large gallery
*  Some activities require physical movement in order to operate
*  These activities include: virtual painting, collaging, researching artists, front-camera self-portraits with editing capabilities, virtual pottery, using AI to draw and match shapes to items within the gallery system
*  The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), in New York City, gives patrons “an unauthorized gallery concept aimed at democratizing physical exhibition spaces, museums, and the curation of art within them.”
* For as little as $8, you can view the exhibit with a VR viewer to take in Wonder. 
* Digital technology is only getting more and more museums on board as they attract a younger crowd.

* AR & VR = "creative implementations" of the technology in gaming, shopping, entertainment, and medical procedures
* VR: create the illusion that you’re in an utterly new world.
* AR: overlay digital information and other content onto a real-world
* there are demands for optimal display resolutions and capabilities that go far beyond what’s necessary when viewing a smartphone at a normal distance
* make very dynamic changes to the displays in real time, all at levels of detail and complexity that have never been required before by mainstream applications
* technology in those products simply wasn’t fast enough to meet the extremely high requirements that a good VR or AR experience demands—especially when you incorporate the need to react to how you move around in real time
* it’s absolutely essential to make these head-mounted displays as light as possible
* Consumers are going to be looking to purchase smartphones that can deliver immersive, compelling augmented reality experiences, so product designers need to plan accordingly.
* Looking forward, we can expect to see even higher-resolution displays, faster response time, and significantly stronger computing horsepower in even smaller, lighter weight head-worn products

* You won’t have to leave your car, but there will be moments when you can stop to watch various actors in scenes that happen concurrently, in the style of influential immersive theater productions like Sleep No More. (Realistically, it’s probably more like your standard haunted house or walk-through theme park experience.)

* If you’re wearing your Disney MagicBand and you’ve made a reservation, a host will greet you at the drawbridge and already know your name---Welcome Mr. Tanner! She’ll be followed by another smiling person---Sit anywhere you like! Neither will mention that, by some mysterious power, your food will find you.
* Their MagicBands, tech-studded wristbands available to every visitor to the Magic Kingdom, feature a long-range radio that can transmit more than 40 feet in every direction.
* The hostess, on her modified iPhone, received a signal when the family was just a few paces away. Tanner family inbound! 
*  it all worked seamlessly, like magic.
*  Walt Disney borrowed against his own life insurance to pay for Disneyland’s original design, and according to friends and family, he never seemed happier. It was his sandbox. 
*  The MagicBands look like simple, stylish rubber wristbands offered in cheery shades of grey, blue, green, pink, yellow, orange and red. Inside each is an RFID chip and a radio like those in a 2.4-GHz cordless phone. 
*  Part of the trick lies in the clever way Disney teaches you to use them---and, by extension, how to use the park. 
*  Then, in the weeks before your trip, the wristband arrives in the mail, etched with your name—I’m yours, try me on. For kids, the MagicBand is akin to a Christmas present tucked under the tree, perfumed with the spice of anticipation. For parents, it’s a modest kind of superpower that wields access to the park.
*  If you sign up in advance for the so-called "Magical Express," the MagicBand replaces all of the details and hassles of paper once you touch-down in Orlando. 
*  Every new experience with technology gently nudges our notions of what we’re comfortable with.
*  Just tap your MagicBand at the gate and swipe onto the rides you’ve already reserved. If you've opted in on the web, the MagicBand is the only thing you need.
*  Its amazing how much friction Disney has engineered away
* For Disney, the MagicBands, the thousands of sensors they talk with, and the 100 systems linked together to create MyMagicPlus turn the park into a giant computer---streaming real-time data about where guests are, what they’re doing, and what they want.
* Disney is thus granted permission to explore services that might seem invasive anywhere else. 
* Disney shrouds its creative process in secrecy. 
* Though the team behind this sprawling platform eventually swelled to more than 1,000 people, the idea started years ago with a handful of insiders.
* Meg Crofton, then president of Walt Disney World Resort, told them to root out all the friction within the Disney World experience. “We were looking for pain points,” she says. “What are the barriers to getting into the experience faster?”
* “They came back with a drawing of the Magic Kingdom without turnstiles,” Crofton says. But, she adds, there was a “domino effect in making one decision.
* Within the company, this cascade of new technologies, and the dream of overhauling the park, thrilled some and threatened others, who fretted over the sheer complexity of it all.
* Nike was using it in virtual events like the Human Race, a global, virtual 10K run that used wearers’ pedometer data. What if Disney did something like that.
* They assembled Frankenstein-like mock-ups using spare parts cribbed from hardware catalogs and torn-down gadgets.
* Great swathes of MyMagicPlus—the MagicBands and their readers, along with pieces of the web portal for making ride reservations—already worked. The bands themselves had been designed, as had the kiosks that would light up with a pleasing chime anytime you swiped.
* Disney was adamant that the band’s design reinforce two key values: Everyone is equal in the park, and everyone is welcome.
* This was represented by the single band with a tearaway option that fit every wrist.
* It took one engineer six months to get the tear-away channel just right.
* The design has a novel and clever cue: Simply touch the circled Mickey icon on the band to the circled Mickey icon on the reader. When everything works, the reader flashes green and emits a pleasing tone; if something goes wrong, it glows blue—never red. Red lights are forbidden at Disney, as they imply something bad happened. Nothing bad can happen at Disney World.
* What followed was two years of grinding work transforming a scripted prototype into a real-world performance, then another 18 months rolling it out in the park. 
* koan: a paradoxical anecdote or riddle, used in Zen Buddhism to demonstrate the inadequacy of logical reasoning and to provoke enlightenment.
* You make people happier not by giving them more options but by stripping them away.
* “The whole system gave Disney a way of understanding the business,” says Franklin, who stepped down last July as Disney’s executive vice president of next-generation experience. “Knowing we need more food here, how people are flowing through the park, how people are consuming the experiential product.”
* It also allows Disney to optimize employees. The goal was to create a system that would essentially replace the time spent fiddling with payments and tickets for moments of personal interactions with visitors. The MagicBands and MyMagicPlus allow employees to “move past transactions, into an interactive space, where they can personalize the experience,” Crofton says. What started as a grand technology platform has inevitably changed the texture of the experience.
* “Walt Disney World is vast. There’s more to do than you could do in a month,” Staggs says. “That choice is overwhelming.”
* There are missions in a vacation,” Staggs says. In other words, Disney knows that parents arrive to its parks thinking: We have to have tea with Cinderella, and where the hell is that Buzz Lightyear thing, anyway? In that way, the park isn’t a playground so much as a videogame, with bosses to be conquered at every level. The MagicBands let you simply set an agenda and let everything else flow around what you’ve selected. “It lets people’s vacations unfold naturally,” Staggs says. “The ability to plan and personalize has given way to spontaneity.” And that feeling of ease, and whatever flows from it, just might make you more apt to come back.
* The MagicBand contains sensors that let guests swipe onto rides and allow Disney to pinpoint their location. At Be Our Guest, they’re what enable the radios in the table and ceiling to triangulate your location so your server can find you. If Disney decides to install those sensors throughout the park, a new world of data opens up. They could have Mickey and Snow White find you. They might use the park’s myriad cameras to capture candid moments of your family—enjoying rides, meeting Snow White—and stitch them together into a personalized film. (The product teams called this the Story Engine.)
* But they might also know when you’ve waited too long in line and email you a coupon for free ice cream or a pass to another ride.
* And with that, they’ll have hooked the white whale of customer service: Turning a negative experience into a positive one. 
* “This is about the experiential Internet. The guest doesn’t need to know how it happened. It’s about the magic of the food arriving.”

These are the experiences that many more designers will soon be striving for: invisible, everywhere, and, in a word, mundane. Which is its own kind of magic.

* Also, https://www.redsharknews.com/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-interactive-cd-rom
* CD-ROM came into the world in the early 90s, just before the internet had really taken off 
* The emerging CD-ROM industry saw itself as separate from the fledgling computer games industry (still working mostly on floppy disc) and very different from the movie business. 
* It couldn’t deliver full screen, full motion video, but it could give you decent audio and lovely graphics with lots of things to click on to lead you to other screens. 
* CD-ROM seemed to be particularly popular on Apple Macs. Macs were still (just about) in ascendance, and HyperCard (a basic programming tool supplied free with Macs) made it relatively easy to author a disc. 
* There was a notion among some filmmakers that this was, somehow, the future of movies.
* The big problem with CD-ROM was that the technology could not deliver anything close to full screen movies. 
* One hugely successful release showed the way forward, and that was the HyperCard-based single-player adventure/puzzle game Myst, originally launched for the Mac in 1993. In six months it sold 200,000 copies, after porting to Windows it went on to sell well over 6 million. 
* Of course, out of the various notions of what CD-ROM was for, games would end up being the great winner, particularly after the rise of the dedicated games console.
*  DVD arrived in the mid 90s to takeover as the premium format for movies, and most of the educational ambitions of the interactive CD-ROM would be subsumed by the internet. 
*  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard
*  HyperCard is a software application and development kit for Apple Macintosh and Apple IIGS computers. It is among the first successful hypermedia systems predating the World Wide Web.
*  HyperCard combines a flat-file database with a graphical, flexible, user-modifiable interface.[2] HyperCard includes a built-in programming language called HyperTalk for manipulating data and the user interface.
*  This combination of features – a database with simple form layout, flexible support for graphics, and ease of programming – suits HyperCard for many different projects such as rapid application development of applications and databases, interactive applications with no database requirements, command and control systems, and many examples in the demoscene.
*  Also, hypertalk https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperTalk
*  HyperTalk favored natural-language ordering of predicates over the ordering used in mathematical notation.
*  HyperCard's primary user interface concept was the card.
*  The graphical layout of the card was created using the mouse by placing various elements on the card, such as text fields and buttons.
*  Containers of a given type were also available as collections with a pluralized version of that container type as its name—the collection of the fields on a card was card fields. 
*  A notable feature of the HyperTalk container model was its handling of text. Every collection of text, whether a literal string in a program or text typed into a text field, was itself considered a container with multiple collections of containers within it
*  HyperTalk used an object-oriented concept for calling scripts, with objects in the stack sending "events" as messages that would be processed by handlers that declared their interest in receiving the events using the on syntax. For instance, most GUI containers would send the mouseDown message when the mouse button was clicked down, and then a mouseUp message when it was released .
*  Messages for events were first sent to the script in the object that created the even
*  One unique distinction between HyperCard's programming language HyperTalk and seemingly similar languages like AppleScript was that HyperTalk scripts were more lenient in what input they accepted
*  Although the HyperTalk language languished just like HyperCard itself, it received a second lease on life through its plugin protocol, so-called External Commands (XCMDs) and External Functions (XFCNs), which were native code containers attached to stacks (as Macintosh-specific resources) with a single entry point and return value.

* The three determinants of interactivty: speed, depth, and choice.
* The faster the feedback turn time, the more interction is possible
* Depth refers to how much mental exertion is required to focus on the activity / task
* Choice - the optins a player / user has. It's not important the number of choices as much as the quality of choices
* Functional significance means to what degree the choice sastisfies a users needs or goals
* Functional bloat is adding functionality that is not functionally significant to a user
* Its important to note that what is functional bloat to one user is functionaly significant to another user.
* You have to balance this for all players.
* ALWAYS ASK, WHAT DOES A USER DO? WHAT ARE THE VERBS?

* People create mental model of the world, this is connected to many different external pieces = their network of understanding of the world around them
* Artists of other mediums can affort to not listen to their audience, but due to the nature of interactivity it is important to reveal the discrepencies between the artists vision and the audience's network
* It is also important that the artist has a vision so that the experience is unified
* Not all feedback needs to be incorporated or the final result will be come muddy, and useless
* And the artist can not solely rely on their ego and vision, elsewise it will miss the mark
* Example of the king taking all the resources for himself, it doesn't work out. He needs to do what's best for the people.
* It is the artists responsibiity to meet each player head-on and make sure they get it.
* Iteractivity isn't binary, or boolean, there is a spectrum of interactivty
* It is a numeric quantity like weight
* Sex, for example is on the high end fo that scale. It's the deepest interaction two people can have.
* Three factors determine the degree of interactivity in storytellng: speed, depth, and choice.

4.17.21
TIL: PP 30-33 Interactive Storytelling - Crawford
* Second-person insight - the ability to experience the story from another's point of view
* Most great artists have a technical inight that allows them to produce great works
* To produce great interactive stories you need to understand how your player / participant / user will interpret and react
* This is more complex than an entertainer who just needs to know which jokes are funny for an example to an audience
* Interactive storytelling has to anticpate reaction to a whole universe of things.
* This involves being able to think like that second person, even when they may think very differently from you.
* Repetition is the way to enforce learning. There may need to be many different ways of saying the same thing to get to all members.

* Spatial thinking and reasoning is part of a story
* Place = Stage
* Stage is a general place where the story takes place
* It need not be connected to another stage in the story
* It need not be overly well defined, unless its important to the interaction between the people in the story
* Time is even less important, it's difficult for people to process the passage of time so you can break the rules and/or pay less respect to the laws of time in a story
* Interaction can be defined as listening, thinking, and speaking
* Computers "listen" for input like via the mouse or keyboard
* Computers "think" by processing information
* Computers "speak" by showing words on the screen
* The above ar some examples of how computers act
* Two parties must both do the interaction steps for it to be an interaction, otherwise it's one-sided, a reaction
