Crawford's Lessons
+ Stories are complex structures that must meet many hard-to-specify requirements
+ Stories are about people, not things
+ Stories are about conflict, most commonly social conflict.
+ Puzzles are a necessary component of stories.
+ Spectacle does not make stories.
+ Visual thinking should not dominate stories.
+ Stories take place on stages, not maps.
+ Your designs should aspire to the ideal of metaphorically having sex with your users.

TIL: PP 33-37 Interactive Storytelling - Crawford
* People create mental model of the world, this is connected to many different external pieces = their network of understanding of the world around them
* Artists of other mediums can affort to not listen to their audience, but due to the nature of interactivity it is important to reveal the discrepencies between the artists vision and the audience's network
* It is also important that the artist has a vision so that the experience is unified
* Not all feedback needs to be incorporated or the final result will be come muddy, and useless
* And the artist can not solely rely on their ego and vision, elsewise it will miss the mark
* Example of the king taking all the resources for himself, it doesn't work out. He needs to do what's best for the people.
* It is the artists responsibiity to meet each player head-on and make sure they get it.
* Iteractivity isn't binary, or boolean, there is a spectrum of interactivty
* It is a numeric quantity like weight
* Sex, for example is on the high end fo that scale. It's the deepest interaction two people can have.
* Three factors determine the degree of interactivity in storytellng: speed, depth, and choice.

* Second-person insight - the ability to experience the story from another's point of view
* Most great artists have a technical inight that allows them to produce great works
* To produce great interactive stories you need to understand how your player / participant / user will interpret and react
* This is more complex than an entertainer who just needs to know which jokes are funny for an example to an audience
* Interactive storytelling has to anticpate reaction to a whole universe of things.
* This involves being able to think like that second person, even when they may think very differently from you.
* Repetition is the way to enforce learning. There may need to be many different ways of saying the same thing to get to all members.

TIL: PP 28-30 Interactive Storytelling - Crawford
* Spatial thinking and reasoning is part of a story
* Place = Stage
* Stage is a general place where the story takes place
* It need not be connected to another stage in the story
* It need not be overly well defined, unless its important to the interaction between the people in the story
* Time is even less important, it's difficult for people to process the passage of time so you can break the rules and/or pay less respect to the laws of time in a story
* Interaction can be defined as listening, thinking, and speaking
* Computers "listen" for input like via the mouse or keyboard
* Computers "think" by processing information
* Computers "speak" by showing words on the screen
* The above ar some examples of how computers act
* Two parties must both do the interaction steps for it to be an interaction, otherwise it's one-sided, a reaction

* The Sensorama, from U.S. Patent #3050870
* The Sensorama was a machine that is one of the earliest known examples of immersive, multi-sensory (now known as multimodal) technology.
* Sensorama was introduced in 1962 by Morton Heilig.
* Mortin Helig was a pioneer in Virtual Reality (VR) technology and filmmaker.
* The Sensorama game gave the player the experience of riding a motorcycle on the streets of Brooklyn. The player felt the wind on their face, the vibration of the motorcycle seat, a 3D view, and even smells of the city.
